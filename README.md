# RGASP3 coverage statistics pipeline

This repository contains the pipeline used for gathering and visualising feature coverage statistics for the [RGASP3](http://www.gencodegenes.org/rgasp/rgasp3.html) project.

## Notes

* The logic for parsing the stranded paired-end reads (human datasets) is hard-coded in the parser class.
